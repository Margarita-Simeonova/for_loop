# For loop - lab

### Tasks:

01. Numbers from 1 to 100:

Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 100, each on a new line.

########

02. Numbers 1...N with Step 3:

Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 100, each on a new line.

########

03. Even Powers of 2

Write a program that reads a number n entered by the user and prints the even powers of 2 ≤ 2^n: 2^6, 2^2, 2^4, 2^6, …, 2^n.

########

04. Numbers N...1

Write a program that reads a positive integer n entered by the user and prints the numbers from n to 1 in reverse order. The entered number n will always be greater than 1.

########

05. Character Sequence

Write a program that reads text (string) entered by the user and prints each character of the text on a separate line.

########

06. Vowels Sum:


To write a program that reads text (string) entered by the user and calculates and prints the sum of the vowel values ​​according to the table below:

letter a e i o u

value  1 2 3 4 5

########

07. Sum Numbers:

To write a program that reads n-th number of integers entered by the user and sums them.

· The number of numbers n is entered from the first line of the input.

· One whole number is entered from the next n lines.

The program must read the numbers, add them, and print the sum.

########

08. Number sequence:

Write a program that reads n number of integers. Print the largest and smallest number among those entered.

########

09. Left and Right Sum:

Write a program that reads 2*n number of user-supplied integers and checks whether the sum of the first n numbers (left sum) is equal to the sum of the second n numbers (right sum). If there is a tie, print " Yes, sum = " + the sum; otherwise it prints " No, diff = " + the difference. The difference is calculated as a positive number (in absolute value).
