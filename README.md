# For loop - lab

### Tasks:

01. Numbers from 1 to 100:

Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 100, each on a new line.

########

02. Numbers 1...N with Step 3:

Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 100, each on a new line.

########

03. Even Powers of 2

Write a program that reads a number n entered by the user and prints the even powers of 2 ≤ 2^n: 2^6, 2^2, 2^4, 2^6, …, 2^n.

########

04. Numbers N...1

Write a program that reads a positive integer n entered by the user and prints the numbers from n to 1 in reverse order. The entered number n will always be greater than 1.

########

05. Character Sequence

Write a program that reads text (string) entered by the user and prints each character of the text on a separate line.

########

06. Vowels Sum:


To write a program that reads text (string) entered by the user and calculates and prints the sum of the vowel values ​​according to the table below:

letter a e i o u

value  1 2 3 4 5

########

07. Sum Numbers:

To write a program that reads n-th number of integers entered by the user and sums them.

· The number of numbers n is entered from the first line of the input.

· One whole number is entered from the next n lines.

The program must read the numbers, add them, and print the sum.

########

08. Number sequence:

Write a program that reads n number of integers. Print the largest and smallest number among those entered.

########

09. Left and Right Sum:

Write a program that reads 2*n number of user-supplied integers and checks whether the sum of the first n numbers (left sum) is equal to the sum of the second n numbers (right sum). If there is a tie, print " Yes, sum = " + the sum; otherwise it prints " No, diff = " + the difference. The difference is calculated as a positive number (in absolute value).

########

10. Odd Even Sum:

Write a program that reads n-th number of integers supplied by the user and checks whether the sum of the numbers in even positions is equal to the sum of the numbers in odd positions. If there is a tie, print two lines:

"Yes" and on a new line "Sum = " + the sum; 

otherwise print "No" and on a new line "Diff = " + the difference. The difference is calculated in absolute value.
